This repository contains the implememntation of the [Car√∏e and Schultz](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167637798000509) propsed branch and bound method encased around [p-Lagrangian  relaxation](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10898-022-01138-y) method to prevent non-convergence due to mixed-integer nature of the input instances. 

# Usage 
1. ## Initialisation of the parameteres for the algorithms and parameters for the Random fucntion
2. ## Initialisation of the parameteres for the test instances 
    - ## 2.a. Randomly generated non-convex MIQCQP instances
    Here is the code
    - ## 2.b. Pooling problem with one pool based stochastic instances
3. ## Running example instance
    Inside the `src` directory we have `experiments.jl` file that contains the example on how to run file using
