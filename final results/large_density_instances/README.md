This folder contains formulations of deterministic equivalents of two-stage stochastic mizxed0itneger problems represented by mixed-integer quadratically constrained quadratic programming problems. The name of each file contains information about parameterisation used for problem generation. 

In particular the file with the name "model_n1_n2_n3_n4_n5_n6_n7" implies that the problem was randomly generated using 
* n1 - number of random seed 
* n2 - value of density for quadratic matrices 
* n3 - number os scenarios 
* n4 - number of first-stage variables (defined per scenario) 
* n5 - number of second-stage variables (defined per scenario) 
* n6 - number of constraints (defined per scenario)
* n7 - value of precision factor for RNMDT relaxation
